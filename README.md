# Modelling the transmisson and spread of Covid-19 

As evidence is emerging that the UK may have passed the initial wave of COVID-19 epidemic, it is important to assess the impact of different mitigations strategies, including scenarios for school reopening. 

This work uses a stochastic individual-based model called Covasim developed by the Institute for Disease Modelling (IDM) and adapted to the UK context to undertake a series modelling analyses exploring the balance between earlier reopening of schools with the risk of occurrence of a secondary COVID-19 pandemic wave in future.

This work has been submitted for publication, and a preprint will be made available shortly.
