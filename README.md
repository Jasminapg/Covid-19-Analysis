# Modelling the transmisson and spread of Covid-19 

As evidence is emerging that the UK may have passed the initial wave of COVID-19 epidemic, it is important to assess the impact of different mitigations strategies, including scenarios for school reopening, alongside reopening society. 

This work uses a stochastic individual-based model called Covasim developed by the Institute for Disease Modelling (IDM) and adapted to the UK context by me to undertake a series modelling analyses exploring the balance between earlier reopening of schools, alongside society with the risk of occurrence of a secondary COVID-19 pandemic wave in future.

This work has recently been published at the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health and available here https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30250-9/fulltext

Follow on work is now looking at evaluating the impact of different non-pharmaceoutical interventions (e.g. use of face coverings) in conjunction with schools reopening, alongide society reopening, or solely.
