# Modelling the transmisson and spread of Covid-19 

As evidence is emerging that we may be approaching the peak of the pandemic here, it is important to assess the impact of different mitigations strategies, including scenarios for school reopening. This work uses a stochastic individual-based model called COVASim developed by the Institute for Disease Modelling (IDM) to undertake a series of COVID-19 epidemiological analyses exploring the potential impact of different school re-opening scenarios.
